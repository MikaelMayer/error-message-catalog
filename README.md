# Error Message Catalog

A set of Elm programs to trigger every possible error message.

Once we build a fairly complete set of error messages, we can use them to start improving error message quality overall. Maybe there will be some interesting patterns. Maybe we will find some easy fixes. Maybe we will find terrible messages that every beginner is guaranteed to run into!

This project will give us the data to evaluate and improve these things!
